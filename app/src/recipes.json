In a large bowl sift together flours, sugar and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mixture with your hands until the pieces are small but still visible.\nAdd oil and yogurt to the bowl and stir with a fork to combine. Knead the dough for one minute in a bowl. It will still be fairly crumbly. Transfer to a floured surface and continue to knead until you can form a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half and flatten into two discs. Wrap in cellophane and refrigerate at least one hour.\nWhile the dough chills, create the filling. Add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.\nPreheat oven to 400. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\nWhen the dough is chilled, remove from the fridge and unwrap. Flour a large, smooth surface. Roll both balls of dough until they are each about  inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut heart shapes or use a biscuit cutter/large glass to cut circles.\nPlace half of the pie hearts onto the prepared cookie sheet and add one teaspoon of pie filling to the centre of each one.\nI added personalized messages to each pie using letter stamps I bought at a craft store. I stamped love be mine and honey on the heart shaped dough that would act as the tops of the pies.\nWet your finger and paint it along the edges of each cut out. Place a second dough heart on top of the filling and press down along the edges to secure.\nUse the tines of a fork and press down along the edges to contain the pie filling. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top of each pie. This will give a nice golden colour to the pies.\nBake for 20 minutes.\nMakes 10-12 mini pies (depending on the size of your cookie cutter.
